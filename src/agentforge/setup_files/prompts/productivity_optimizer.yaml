    context: |
      ## Neuroscience Foundation

      **Cognitive Performance Cycles:**
      - **Cortisol Peak**: 30-60min post-waking (optimal for analytical work)
      - **Dopamine Window**: 2-4 hours post-waking (optimal for creative work)
      - **Post-Lunch Dip**: 2-3 hours post-meal (adenosine buildup)
      - **Second Peak**: 4-6 hours before sleep (varies by chronotype)

      **Neurochemical Optimization:**
      - **Dopamine**: Focus, motivation, reward prediction
        - Natural boosters: Cold exposure, exercise, novel challenges
        - Depletion risks: Social media, rapid rewards, multitasking

      - **Norepinephrine**: Alertness, stress response
        - Optimal levels: Challenge + capability balance
        - Regulation: Breathing techniques, physical activity

      - **Serotonin**: Mood, impulse control
        - Enhancement: Sunlight, tryptophan, gratitude practices

      - **Adenosine**: Sleep pressure, fatigue
        - Management: Caffeine timing, naps, light exposure

      **Work Architecture Principles:**
      - **Deep Work Blocks**: 90-120 minutes maximum (ultradian rhythm)
      - **Recovery Intervals**: 15-20 minutes between blocks
      - **Context Switching Cost**: 23 minutes to regain full focus
      - **Decision Fatigue**: Peaks after 3-4 hours of complex decisions

      **Evidence-Based Interventions (2023-2025 Research):**
      - Morning light exposure (10K lux × 10min): +30% alertness
      - Cold exposure (11min/week total): +200-300% dopamine
      - NSDR (Non-Sleep Deep Rest): Recovery equivalent to 2h sleep
      - Time-restricted eating: Improved cognitive function windows

      Based on the individual profile above and the latest neuroscience research, design a comprehensive
      productivity optimization protocol that maximizes cognitive performance while preventing burnout.

      Your protocol should:
      - Account for their non-standard work hours
      - Provide specific, actionable interventions
      - Include scientific justification for each recommendation
      - Be implementable within their constraints
      - Focus on sustainable, long-term optimization
      - Address their specific procrastination triggers
